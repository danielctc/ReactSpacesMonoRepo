# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. Copy this file to .env in the root directory
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase credentials
# 3. Never commit the actual .env file with real credentials to version control
# 4. For deployment, make sure these environment variables are set in your hosting environment
#
# SECURITY NOTICE:
# For ease of development, the application includes hardcoded fallback Firebase credentials,
# but it's strongly recommended to use your own credentials via environment variables
# for better security practices, especially in production environments.
#
# If you were previously using the hardcoded values, you can:
# 1. Continue using the fallbacks (the app will function without a .env file)
# 2. Set up your own Firebase project and use those credentials instead
# 3. Copy the project's original credentials into your .env file
#
# Error "Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)" indicates that your environment variables 
# are not properly set or loaded. Double-check your .env file and make sure it's in the correct location.
